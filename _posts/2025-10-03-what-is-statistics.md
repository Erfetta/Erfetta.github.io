Statistics is the science of collecting, analyzing, and interpreting data. 
It helps us make informed decisions by identifying patterns and trends.

In cybersecurity, statistics is very useful because it allows experts 
to detect anomalies, measure risks, and predict possible attacks. 
For example, by analyzing login attempts or unusual network traffic, 
statistics can highlight suspicious activity and help protect systems.
